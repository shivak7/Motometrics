The files in this folder demonstrate how to convert Data files exported from AD instruments and TDT to Motometrics suitable formats.
The data files should be exported to MATLAB first before using these scripts.

For TDT look at: TDT2Motometrics.m
For AD instruments look at: AD2Motometrics.m

AD2Motometrics is more detailed in the process of reformatting MEP data.
Specifically examine the file: preformat_Datafile.m  

This is a detailed way of reformatting most data from almost any electrophysiology system regardless of if the trials were randomized or not.
